## Continue learning
I can highly reccommend [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) it is a free intuitive learning platform for git. That delves into Branching, rebasing, cherrypicking, merging and much more git stuff.

Secondly, [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_getstarted1) also proivde some simple git exercise if you want to continue further.
