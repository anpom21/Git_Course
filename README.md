Welcome to the **Git Robcourse Repository**! This collection is designed to enhance your understanding and proficiency with Git through practical exercises.

## Getting Started

To begin working with these exercises:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anpom21/Git_Course.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Exercise**:
   ```bash
   cd Git_Course/"Exercise 1 - Git it started"
   ```
   *(Replace with the appropriate exercise directory.)*

3. **Follow the Instructions**:
   Each exercise directory contains a `Exercise x - Guide.pdf` with specific instructions and objectives. Please refer to these files to guide your learning process.

## Prerequisites

- **Git Installation**: Ensure that Git is installed on your system. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Basic Command Line Knowledge**: Familiarity with terminal or command prompt operations will be beneficial.

## Continue learning
I can highly reccommend [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) it is a free intuitive learning platform for git. That delves into Branching, rebasing, cherrypicking, merging and much more git stuff.
This [git practice GitHub]([url](https://github.com/danrs/git-practice)) also goes through a lot of cool features like resetting the repo, both soft, hard and mixed resets. It goes into stashing when you just want to save your changes and then check out another branch.
Secondly, [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_getstarted1) also proivde some simple git exercise if you want to continue further.
